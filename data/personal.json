  "summary": "I am a versatile technologist with hands-on experience across web development, IT support, and automation. My toolkit spans WordPress, PHP, MySQL, Node.js, React, and API integration, as well as infrastructure, networking, and Linux server management. I enjoy building solutions that are robust, scalable, and user-focused—whether that means developing custom web applications, optimizing cloud deployments, or troubleshooting complex network issues. I am comfortable learning new frameworks and tools, and I thrive in environments where adaptability, clear communication, and ownership are valued. My approach is practical and collaborative: sharing knowledge and delivering results that make a real impact—no matter the technology stack.",
