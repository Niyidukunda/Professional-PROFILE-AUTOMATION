Full-Stack Developer & Network Support Technician | Johannesburg & Durban, South Africa

I am an IT professional with 3+ years of experience building websites and supporting over 50 students and clients. I am skilled in WordPress, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SEO, and have a proven record of quickly learning new tools and platforms. While I have not yet worked with Webflow, Shopify, or GSAP, my experience with WordPress, custom themes, and web animations shows I can adapt fast. I am comfortable with no-code tools, have collaborated with designers, and am eager to learn new systems like Webflow, Figma, and automation platforms. My hands-on approach, strong troubleshooting skills, and passion for web technology make me a great fit for fast-paced teams.
